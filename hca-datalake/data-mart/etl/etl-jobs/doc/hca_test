# HCA CLI Testing
This documentation will go over the process of testing ETL's using the hca_cli testing functionality. The background will be discussed and a example will be provided for the **fund.fund_composite** ETL.

## Background and requirements
The hca_cli testing function requires three folders for each ETL - raw, before, and after. Each folder contains files that will be used to generate the in-memory tables that will be used for comparison, and the files will remain unchanged. 
```text
|-- ETL_name
	|-- after
	|-- before
	|-- raw
```
`after` - contains the *source of truth* as a CSV. This is what the ETL should produce if it runs correctly.
`before` - contains the *source of truth* before the ETL is run. To represent an empty database (i.e. a first time load) the before file should contain only the header of the *after* CSV. 
`raw` - contains the data to be ingested by the ETL that is being tested as a CSV.

To run the test, use the hca_cli within the `scripts` folder:

```
(venv) vagrant@ubuntu-bionic:~/etl-jobs/scripts$ ./hca_cli test --help
Usage: hca_cli test [OPTIONS]

Options:
  --jobname TEXT      job name to test. If blank and test.ini file exists,
                      will be taken from ini file
  --datafolder TEXT   location of 'before' 'after' folders  [required]
  --ignore-cols TEXT  comma delimited list of columns to ignore for comparison
                      purposes. If blank and test.ini file exists, will be
                      taken from ini file
  --help              Show this message and exit.
```
