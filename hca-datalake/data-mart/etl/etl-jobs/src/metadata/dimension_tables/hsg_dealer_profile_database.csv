<p><em>Fund Company agrees to transfer shares between accounts for Schwab customers or other street name brokers held directly with a Fund and the Account on the Fund's records.&#160; For the purpose of expediting direct transfers from accounts for Schwab customers, Fund Company will accept by facsimile transmission a summary sheet of information indicating the customers' names, account numbers, the Fund affected and the number of shares to be re-registered.&#160; For record keeping purposes, actual copies of transfer forms will be forwarded to a Fund on a weekly basis, upon the Fund's request for such forms.&#160; Schwab represents and warrants that for each transfer indicated in the summary sheet of information, it holds each underlying instruction for re-registration signed by its customer, and that its customer's signature on such instruction is signature guaranteed by Schwab pursuant to the New York Stock Exchange's Medallion Signature Program.</em></p>
<p><span><span style=""text-decoration&#58;underline;"">Invoicing</span> </span>- The Schwab invoice breaks out RPS assets only for funds that are subject to different fee rates for RPS and non-RPS assets.&#160; For funds subject to the same fee rate for RPS and non-RPS assets, the invoice and data warehouse show all assets as non-RPS.</p>
<p>Schwab invoices 12b-1 and Sub TA fees as one combined rate (e.g. 35 bp for a 25 bp 12b-1 fee and 10 bp Sub TA fee).​</p>

<p><span><span style=""text-decoration&#58;underline;"">Medallion Signature Guarantees</span> </span>- The Asset Transfer Agreement with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner, &amp; Smith, dated September 20, 2006, contains the following language&#58;</p>
<p><em>Whereas, MLPF&amp;S and Harbor Services Group Inc desire to transfer customer shares of the Fund to the customers' MLPF&amp;S accounts in the most efficient and cost-effective manner; </em></p>
<p><em>Now therefore, in consideration of the representations, warranties and covenants hereinafter set forth, each party hereto agrees as follows&#58;</em></p>
<p><em>Harbor Services Group agrees that, upon receipt of a Transfer Initiation Request. . . it shall transfer to an&#160;MLPF&amp;S account the specified shares of the Fund in accordance with mutually agreed procedures.&#160; . . . MLPF&amp;S represents and warrants that, prior to submitting a Transfer Initiation Request to Harbor Services Group Inc, it will have obtained all authorizations and appointments necessary to act as attorney for the customer with full right, power, authority and capacity to transfer the customer's shares on the books of the Fund.&#160; MLPF&amp;S agrees to provide copies of such authorizations and appointments to Harbor Services Group Inc upon reasonable notice.</em></p>

<p>No Load - MFA ERISA = Customer accounts (held in fee based programs)</p>
<p>No Load = Customer accounts (held in fee based programs)</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Note that Merrill Lynch calculates fees&#160;by&#160;dividing the fee rate by&#160;12 months, rather than&#160;weighting the rate based on the number of days in each month (30/365, for example).&#160;&#160;Legal and Accounting are aware of this,&#160;and&#160;their contract&#160;allows for this method.&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Note that Merrill Lynch processes transactions through Fund/SERV on behalf of Bank of America, NA (&quot;BANA&quot;).&#160; The list of funds available under the BANA agreement (Schedule A) differs from the list of funds available under the Merrill Lynch agreements.&#160; As such, Merrill Lynch may hold certain&#160;funds that are not specifically referenced under their agreement.&#160; These funds are not eligible for fees.&#160; (As of the 11/11/2012 amendment to BANA's Schedule A, the funds available under the BANA agreement are 2024, 2014, and 2029.)</p><p>Merrill Lynch receives a SPAC file rather than refresher files for their omnibus positions.&#160; In order for Merrill Lynch to accept commissions for reps with assets held outside the Omnibus positions, they need to receive a position file listing the specific accounts.&#160; If Merrill Lynch is refusing to accept payment, work with BMG to get these accounts added to their refresher file.&#160; This is usually done by a dealer/branch combination.</p><p>Merrill's processing deadline for prior day trades is 10&#58;00 AM CT</p>

<p>Newport is made up of three legacy organizations&#58; Verisight, DAC, and Newport Group. The legacy Newport Group business is the block of plans for which Matrix submits invoicing. The Verisight and DAC plans have the custodian collect all of their fees. As such, accounts that are set up through Mid Atlantic as custodian and record-kept by Newport are coded with Mid Atlantic's TPA (100101) to generate payments to Mid Atlantic.</p><p>Although the Newport agreement includes both 12b-1 fees and Sub TA fees, Newport currently serves only as a recordkeeper.&#160; The accounts are structured such that a separate dealer of record receives the 12b-1 fees and Newport is listed as TPA and receives the Sub TA fees.&#160; Newport invoices for these fees on a monthly basis.</p>
<p>Newport has indicated in&#160;that invoices are generated based on monthly balances.&#160; If an account closes during a particular period, the entire average balance is removed for that period even if the account held shares during the period. (Source&#58; e-mail from Tracy Eduoard on 1/25/2012)</p>
<p>Effective March 2013, Newport has elected to receive their fees through Harbor's MTF system. </p>
